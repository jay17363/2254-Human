            Extreme Dwarfanators Wrestling is a high-flying, body-slamming, no-holds-barred wrestling spectacle where athletes with dwarfism bring the pain and the laughs in equal measure. Think WWE, with more speed, heart, and fewer wasted moves. These wrestlers may be small in stature, but they bring giant-sized entertainment, flipping, slamming, and smack-talking their way into the hearts of fans everywhere.
